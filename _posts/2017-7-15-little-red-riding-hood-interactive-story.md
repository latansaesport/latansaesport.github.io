With the release of version 3 of the [Elm Narrative Engine](http://elmnarrativeengine.com/), I made a series of demos to show off how flexible the engine had become.  The demos included a "classic" text-based version of the story of Little Red Riding Hood, as well as a "point and click" style version (with amazing art from Samuel Herb), and a top-down RPG style version that integrated with [phaser.js](https://phaser.io/).

The power behind these demos is that the engine and rules for the narrative are the same between each version, with only the presentation layer changing, to create vastly different playing experiences.

You can play each of these variations here:
