*Note: not completely finished!*

This is a simple game based on the [Stroop effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect).  It is best played on mobile.

Its simplicity is its strength, and I am very pleased how simple the interface is, and yet how challenging it can be.  I worked hard on the pacing in this game, and developed 36 levels of increasing complexity and iteration on the main mechanic.  It is the first game I have done with a level selection and advancement system.  I intend to make a better title screen and release it on the mobile app stores.

My favorite part of the game is the soundtrack, by Josh Cutler.
