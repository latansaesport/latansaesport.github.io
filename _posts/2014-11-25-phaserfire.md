description: Classic space shooter game made to teach the phaser.js game engine
order: 400

When I was first learning game dev I learned the [phaser.js](https://phaser.io/) engine, which is still one of the most popular javascript game engines today.  I made this game as a tutorial to teach others what I learned.  The [tutorial](http://codeperfectionist.com/articles/phaser-js-tutorial-building-a-polished-space-shooter-game-part-1/) is still online if you are interested, though it is very out of date!

My main focus in this game was adding "polish."  Notice how the ships appear to tilt as they bank from side to side.  I also put a lot of effort into the exhaust from the ships, and I tried to make each ship type act in a unique way.  I am especially proud of the boss ship and how it "hunts" you and charges its weapons before shooting.
