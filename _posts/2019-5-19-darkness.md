description: Twine-like narrative game about finding hope
order: 350

I made this game as an experiment to see if I could make a Twine-like game with the [Elm Narrative Engine](http://elmnarrativeengine.com/).  Like Twine, the interactive links are inline with the prose of the story, but unlike Twine, you can click on these links more than once, and different things happen depending on what has happened so far.

I entered this game into the [2019 Spring Thing festival](https://www.springthing.net/2019/play.html#Darkness), which was a fun experience.  I wrote a [postmortem](http://blog.elmnarrativeengine.com/2019/05/19/spring-thing-2019-darkness-postmortem/) about the experience.
