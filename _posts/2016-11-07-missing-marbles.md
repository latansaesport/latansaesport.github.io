*Note: the Elm Narrative Engine is in active developement*

One of my most ambitious recent undertakings has been building the open-source [Elm Narrative Engine](http://elmnarrativeengine.com/), a tool for building iterative stories, which combines my passions of coding and storytelling.

This story demonstrates the type of stories the engine makes (at least at version 2.0, which is already outdated and limited).  You play by clicking on different items, locations, and characters, which will advance the story based on what you have done so far.
